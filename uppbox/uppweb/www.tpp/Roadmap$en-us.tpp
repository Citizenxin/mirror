[s24; Current release&]
[s3; 2017.1 (rev 10804) (Jan 2017)&]
[s5; This is the first release of U`+`+ that [*/ requires] C`+`+11 
compatible compiler. The main focus was [* Core], adding many enhancements 
allowed by C`+`+11 and improved parallel programming support. 
We, also didn`'t forget about Android and we ported Core library 
on that platform.&]
[s22; Core&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; Original U`+`+ Callbacks are deprecated and replaced 
with Function with better lambda support.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; Begin/End methods are now renamed / deprecated 
in favor of (standard) begin/end.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; U`+`+ algorithms now primarily work on [/ ranges], 
besides container SubRange, ConstRange and ViewRange are now 
provided.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; Initial round of optimizations for ARM architecture.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; U`+`+ allocator optimized once again, locking is 
reduced in inter`-thread deallocations, allocator now returns 
blocks always 16 bytes aligned (simplifies SSE2 code).&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; General cleanup of U`+`+ algorithms, redundant 
algorithms removed, new Count and CountIf algorithms&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; Improvements in Core/RPC&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; CoWork`::FinLock now provides `'free of charge`' 
mutex at the end of worker jobs.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; CoWorkerResources class now provides `'per worker 
thread`' context.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; CoPartition algorithm useful for partitioning array 
for parallel programming.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; Where it makes sense, U`+`+ algorithms now have 
parallel variant.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; String further optimized, new TrimLast, TrimStart, 
TrimEnd, FindAfter, ReverseFindAfter&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; FastCompress (currently using LZ4) for internal 
program compression.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; Core can be compiled on Android and major of features 
are currently ported.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; xxHash `- fast non`-cryptographic hash `- now part 
of Core.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; SHA256 code now part of the Core.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; plugin/pcre updated to the latest pcre version.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; plugin/zstd now provides [^http`:`/`/facebook`.github`.io`/zstd`/^ zs
td] compression (with multithreaded option).&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; plugin/lz4 now can multithreaded.&]
[s22; GUI programming `& graphics&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; PdfDraw and RichText now support PDF signatures.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; RichText now can change header/footer within document.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; ArrayCtrl got SetLineColor and GetCellRect methods.&]
[s22; TheIDE&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; Comments now can be spell checked and there is 
comment word wrap and reformatting operation.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; New functions / icons that search the web (launch 
the browser) for text selected or current identifier.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; Optimal compilation mode is removed as confusing, 
it is now always either debug or release mode, release mode being 
configured for speed.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; When comparing files, differences within single 
lines are now shown.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; Most U`+`+ designers now support drag`&drop to 
reorganize lists.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; Find File window was remastered.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; New dialog for creating package file.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; Android application can be directly launch on emulator 
from TheIDE.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; Clang is now default compiler for native Android 
applications.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; C`+`+14 is now default standard for all Android 
builds.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; Various android builder improvements.&]
[s22; ESC&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; New math functions like sin, cos, tg, pow etc.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; New replace in string function.&]
[s22; General&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; Significantly improved the process of building 
TheIDE and UMK from tarball (POSIX environment). Compilation 
on multiple cores is possible with `"`-j`" option.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; Documentation improvements.&]
[s5;l160;i150;O0; Bug fixes in various areas.&]
